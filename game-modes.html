 <p>VALORANT features multiple game modes categorized as Plant/Defuse or Deathmatch type. There are permanent modes that include Competitive, Unrated, Spike Rush, and Deathmatch. There's also a lineup of rotating game modes that change every patch update (like Snowball Fight). (CODASHOP 2021)</p>

 <p>unrated which is the main gamemode can be played unranked and ranked. spike rush is unrated but with some twists. deathmatch is a 12 player all out battle to get the most kills. replication is unrated but every team has 5 players of the same character. snowball fight is self-explanitory and a winter-only type game-mode. escalation is like gungame so you have to get an amount of kills to move on to the next gun, 5v5 as well. this was my own take</p>
 </div>
</div>
 <div id="game3">
 <p>in unrated, you either defend or attack different sites in order to win the game. You win the game by winning 13 rounds and whoever attacks/deffends changes after 12 rounds. In order to win rounds the attackers have to either kill the entire enemy team or plant a spike that detonates after 40 seconds. As a deffender you have to either kill the entire enemy team or defuse the spike when it has been planted to win. also my own take</p>

 <p>Valorant is a tactical shooting game involving two teams with 5 players in each team. Every player can sign in and play remotely from anywhere in the world. Every game has 25 rounds and the team that wins 13 of them first wins the game. Players can choose their in-game characters called agents at the start of the game. (LIVEMINT 2020)</p>

 <p>What are the different roles in VALORANT? Within the game, agents are broken down into four general roles: Sentinels; Controllers; Initiators; and Duelists. These roles are then broken down into more specialised positions such as Support, In-game Leader, Entry Fragger, Lurker, Recon, and Crowd. (PINACLE 2022)</p>

 <div id="game3">
 <p>in valorant, your goal is to either defend or attack different sites in order to win the game. You win the game by winning 13 rounds and whoever attacks/deffends changes after 12 rounds. In order to win rounds the attackers have to either kill the entire enemy team or plant a spike that detonates after 40 seconds. As a deffender you have to either kill the entire enemy team or defuse the spike when it has been planted to win. Valorant was developed with two main focuses: making tactical shooters and e-sports more accessible to new players, and creating a game that would attract a large competitive scene, while solving many of the points of criticism voiced by professional players from games in the genre.
